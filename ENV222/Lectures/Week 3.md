Lecture 5: 
- Historical Perspectives: Agriculture, Food Production, and Land Use
	- Taking a look at the historical context of the ecological crisis, how did we get where we are?
	- **Agriculture is neglected, food production has the largest food print of any human activity**
- Agriculture and food production:
	- There's a unique role of food vs. Air and water
	- 50% of human population are farmers, 50% of them being women
