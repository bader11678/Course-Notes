Consider the documentary you watched for assignment 1, from the perspective of environmental science. Think about the events that occurred in the earth’s history that caused major changes to the earth. Think about the current environmental issues we face today which are also causing major changes to the earth. What conclusions can you draw about past and present environmental change? How are they different?
- **Past Environmental Changes**
	- Planetary Formation and Bombardment
		- Earth formed ~4.5 billion years ago from cosmic dust and debris.
		- Constant asteroid and meteor bombardments shaped the surface and delivered water and carbon-based molecules — essential for life.
	- Volcanic Activity
		- Massive volcanic eruptions released gases that created Earth’s early atmosphere and oceans.
		- These eruptions also triggered climate changes and extinction events.
	- Oxygenation Event
		- Cyanobacteria produced oxygen through photosynthesis, shifting Earth’s atmosphere dramatically (~2.5 billion years ago).
		- This enabled complex life but caused the extinction of anaerobic organisms — a massive biological shift.
	- Ice Ages and Extinctions
		- Natural cycles led to multiple ice ages, reshaping landscapes and wiping out species (e.g., Snowball Earth episodes).
		- Mass extinction events (like the one that killed the dinosaurs) drastically altered biodiversity.
- **Present Environmental Changes**
	- Anthropogenic Climate Change
	    - Unlike past events, current global warming is caused primarily by human activities (fossil fuel burning, deforestation).
	    - This change is **faster** and **more global** than most natural shifts.
	- Pollution and Biodiversity Loss
	    - Plastic waste, chemical pollutants, and habitat destruction are reducing species at an alarming rate.
	    - We are now in what many call the “Sixth Mass Extinction,” driven by human action.
	- Deforestation & Urbanization
	    - Large-scale land-use changes alter ecosystems and carbon cycles, contributing to warming and weather instability.

Key Points:
- Past is natural events, present is human driven
- Past happened over millions of years, present is happening over decades and centuries
- Past had multiple species influencing the change, present is one species (humans)
- Past had no intention, present is conscious but ignored

Age of Dinosaurs:
- Nature driven compared to human driven changes


- Look at other sources (cite them), whether articles or info pages. Video is surface level (might've, could, etc.). Look deeper into the topics. Stick to page maximum.
- Quality over quantity
- For sources, stick to how many points (1 point, 1 mark, 2 points, 2 marks. Cite them)
- You can answer each question individually. Straight up answer the question. In an essay format, apa, a front cover, reference page.
- There are decimal points, but you want 100%
- For 1 marks, if the documentary is enough, then do that only
- Whatever you put down the answer, you must be clearly answering the question. Ask yourself, does this really answer the question?
