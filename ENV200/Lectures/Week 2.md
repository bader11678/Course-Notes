	- Chapter conclusions are important for the midterm and final exam
	- 

**Lecture 3: Environmental Systems - Energy and Material Cycles, Part 1**
- Learning Outcomes: 
	- Learn the building blocks of the ecosystem
	- Learn about the elements of life: Matter, Energy, and the Ecosystem
- **Systems Describe Interactions**
	- A **system** is a network of **interdependent components** and processes with materials and energy flowing from one component of the system to another
		- Think of a PC, it's a system where each part works with the other to make one full system (the PC) work the way it should be.
	- An **ecosystem** is a complex assemblage (AKA collection) of animals, plants, and their environment, through which materials and energy move.
	- Prof. Mentioned **Trophic levels**, look it up.
- **Systems can be described in General terms**
	- A simple system consists of:
		- State variables: AKA compartments, they're essential pieces of a system. 
			- Stores resources such as energy, matter, or water
			- They're basically each PC part, individually (i.e. GPU, RAM, PSU)
		- Flows: AKA pathways, by which those resources (state variables) move from one state variable to another 
			- Basically the wires that connect the PC parts together

	- Sun powers plants-> plants eaten by rabbit -> rabbit eaten by fox -> fox dies, decomposes -> composition helps plants -> plants eaten by rabbit -> etc.
- **Systems can be described in terms of their characteristics**
	- Types of systems:
		- **Open systems**: systems that receive inputs from their surroundings and produce outputs that leave the system (i.e. hydrological cycle)
		- **Closed systems**: Self regulated systems. Systems that exchange no energy or matter with its surroundings (i.e. planet earth)
		- **Throughput**: a term used to describe the energy and matter that flow into, through, and out of a system (i.e. trophic level)
			- Read more about Throughput
- **Feedback loops help stabilize systems**
	- Systems function in cycles, with each component eventually feeding back to influence the size or rate of itself
	- A **positive feedback** loop tends to increase a process or component
	- A **negative feedback** loop diminishes a process or component
- **Elements of Life**
	- What exactly are the materials that flow through a system?
		- Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass
			- Solid
			- Liquid
			- Gas
	- The principles of **conservation of matter** states that, under ordinary circumstances, matter is neither created nor destroyed but rather is recycled over and over again.
- Organic compounds have a Carbon Backbone
	- Carbon is a special element because chains and rings of carbon atoms form the skeletons of **organic compounds**, the material of which biomolecules, and therefore living organisms, are made
		- Q7 of A 1: Formation of Life
	- The four major categories of organic compounds in living things (bio-organic compounds) are:
		- **Lipids**: includes fats and oils, store energy for cells and provide the core of cell membranes and other structures
		- **Carbohydrates**: includes sugars and starches, also store energy and provide structure to cells. They consist of a long chain of simple sugars like glucose
		- **Proteins**: composed of chains of amino acids folded into complex 3 D shapes. Proteins provide structure to cells and are used for countless cell functions, including enzymes
		- **Nucleic acids**: complex molecules made of a 5-carbon sugar that stores genetic information. Extremely important as signaling molecules and as sources within cells.
- Cells are the fundamental units of life
	- All living organisms are composed of cells
	- Cells are assembled of bio-organic compounds in complex ways
- Nitrogen and Phosphorus are key nutrients
	- Carbon (C) is captured from air by plants, and oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) derive from air or water
	- Additional elements include Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P), which are essential parts of the proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids in cells
	- You derive these elements by consuming foods, but plants must extract these elements from their environments
	- Low levels of N and P often limit growth in ecosystem where they are scarce, and abundance of them cause runaway growth
- Energy
	- Energy is the ability to do work such as moving matter over a distance or causing heat transfer between two objects at different temperatures
	- Energy can take many different forms: heats, light, electricity, and chemical energy
- Kinetic Energy
	- The energy contained in moving objects
		- Examples: rock rolling down a hill, water flowing through a dam, electrons speeding around a nucleus
- Potential Energy
	- Stored energy available for use
		- Example: a rock at the top of a hill (prior to rolling down)
		- Basically the energy that's preserved before converting into kinetic energy
	- Chemical energy stored in food I eat and gas put into cars are examples as well.
- Energy Basics
	- Heat describes energy that is transferred between objects of different temperatures
	- Thermodynamics deals with how energy is transferred in natural processes
		- First law: energy is conserved
		- Second law: with each energy transfer, less energy is available to do the work
			- Second law recognizes entropy tends to increase in all natural systems (disorder)
- Energy for Life
	- The Sun considered the ultimate energy source
	- Energy is captured by green plants which are often called **primary producers** because they create carbs and other compounds using just sunlight, air, and water
	- These organisms get their energy in other ways. These organisms gain their energy through chemosynthesis, a process which allows them to extract energy from inorganic chemical compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S).
- Green Plants get energy from the Sun
	- All organisms on the earth rely on the thermonuclear reactions from the sun, leading to processes such as photosynthesis from plants (converts light energy into chemical bonds that hold organic molecules together).
- Energy Exchange in Ecosystems
	- Photosynthesis is an example
- Populations, Communities, and Ecosystems
	- Population: all members living somewhere at the same time
- Food Chains, Food Webs, and Trophic Levels link Species
	- 
- Trophic Levels




**Lecture 4: Evolution Species Interactions**
- Learning outcomes: 
	- Learn about evolution, adaptation, and symbiosis
- Case study: Darwin
	- All BS lol 
- Evolutions and natural selection
	- Adaptation: acquiring traits that allows a species to ssurvive in an environment
		- Involves changes in a population, with traits passing down from one generation to the next
		- Process of fittest individuals passing their traits to the next generation is called **natural selection**
- Natural selection acts on traits in the DNA

- Keystone Species
	- The top predator in a biological community
	- Keeps the balance of the communities
